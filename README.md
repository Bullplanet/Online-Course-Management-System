# 🎓 Online Course Management System

This is a simple console-based **Online Course Management System** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python. It's designed as a hands-on project to practice core OOP concepts like classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and relationships between objects.


## 📌 Features Implemented

- 👤 **User Types**:
  - `Student`: Enrolls in or drops courses, views personal profile, and enrolled courses.
  - `Instructor`: Assigned to courses, views profile, and sees enrolled students.

- 📚 **Course**:
  - Students can enroll/unenroll from a course.
  - Instructors can be assigned/unassigned to courses.
  - Tracks students and instructors for each course.

- ✅ Core OOP Concepts:
  - Classes & Objects
  - Inheritance (`Student`, `Instructor` inherit from `User`)
  - Encapsulation (`__email` is private)
  - Method interaction between classes
  - `__str__()` overrides for readable output
  - One-to-many relationships between courses and users

💡 Upcoming Enhancements:

✅ Polymorphism (Next step)

🔁 Magic Methods and Custom Behaviors

🌐 File/Database integration (for real-world simulation)

📊 CLI or basic GUI (future optional)

📚 Purpose:

This project is part of my Python OOP interview prep and coding portfolio. Feel free to fork, clone, or contribute if you're also learning Python or preparing for technical interviews!
